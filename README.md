# `todo`

> This is currently very much work-in-progress.

`todo` helps you track project-wide tasks without leaving your terminal and
versioning system (like Git).

Tasks live in a `tasks` directory, are tracked by your CVS, and can be
cross-referenced with `TODO`s in your code. `todo` indexes and lets you query
the tasks with a nice terminal UI. It can also detect untracked tasks and alert
you to them.

## License

`todo` is released to the public domain under [the Unlicense](./UNLICENSE).

## Prior art

This project is based on [Tsoding's `snitch`](https://github.com/tsoding/snitch)
and a lot of the work he does on his live streams.
